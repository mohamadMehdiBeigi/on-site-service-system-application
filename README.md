This is an on-site service application where specialists can register with complete details. Upon approval by the management of this web application, they can first select the desired service based on their expertise, and even more specifically define their field of work along with the fee and other details in the service section. Customers can also register in this system, place their orders in the orders section based on their needs, and wait to receive proposals from specialists, considering the start time and total hours required to complete the job. After approval and start of work, customers can pay the specialist’s proposed amount either through their credit or online, considering the application’s commission. Furthermore, customers can rate and comment on the specialist. 
Specialists can also partially view all their ratings and see their average ratings. If a specialist exceeds the time defined for completing the job in the proposals section and the work isn’t finished within that time, one point will be deducted from the average rating for each additional hour.
If the average rating reaches zero, the specialist’s account will be automatically deactivated.
